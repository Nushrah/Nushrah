## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science student who thrives on turning complex challenges into transformative, user-centric solutions. From boosting organizational efficiency by up to 90% with my React and TypeScript expertise to enhancing workplace accessibility and security through thoughtful design and secure APIs, I continually seek new ways to deliver measurable impact. With hands-on experience in diverse projectsâ€”from interactive data analyses to mobile-responsive web applicationsâ€” Iâ€™m eager to contribute my innovation, collaboration, and technical flair to a team striving for the same.
